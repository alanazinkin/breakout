## Class Ideas

 * Idea #1: A block class with different types of blocks that inherit the same class.
    This class might have the method ".break" to break the block when hit by a ball

 * Idea #2: A ball class with various types of balls. For example, some balls can be different sizes.
This class might contain the method ".move" to move the ball around the scene.

    getting extra balls. One method in this class could be ".get" which means the player gets a power up to use.

 * Idea #4: A paddle class with various types of paddles such as larger paddles, which make it easier to play
 or paddles with different types of materials that make the ball bounce slower or faster.
