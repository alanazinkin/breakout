# Breakout Plan
### Alana Zinkin


#### Examples

You need to put blank lines to write some text

in separate paragraphs.


Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.


You can also make lists:
* Bullets are made with asterisks
1. You can order things with numbers.

## Interesting Breakout Variants

 * Idea #1: The super breakout variant is interesting because it allows the player to keep track of their score
and provides the opportunity to level up their score by hitting different blocks.

 * Idea #2: The balls and bricks variant is interesting because it feels like an entirely new game, yet only requires
small updates to the original breakout game. 


## Paddle Ideas

 * Idea #1: Catch and release paddle

 * Idea #2: V shaped paddle with two sides

 * Idea #3: Each side of paddle (left, center, right) directs the ball in the
corresponding direction


## Block Ideas

 * Idea #1: Tough blocks that take 5 hits to break

 * Idea #2: Different shaped blocks (ex: triangles and squares)

 * Idea #3: Blocks that release a power up when destroyed

 * Idea #4: Blocks that explode other surrounding blocks when destroyed 


## Power-up Ideas

 * Idea #1: Extra balls 

 * Idea #2: Slowing down the ball

 * Idea #3: Larger paddle size


## Cheat Key Ideas

* Idea #1: if the player holds down "delete", they will receive an extra life

* Idea #2: if the player presses "1" and "8" simultaneously, the ball will start to move in the other direction as if it hit something

* Idea #3: if the player hits the key "!", they will clear the current level

* Idea #4: if the player hits the key "?", the player will receive a random power up.


## Level Descriptions

 * Idea #1: The levels become increasingly challenging by increasing the number of
"tough" blocks that require more hits. 

 * Idea #2: The levels become increasingly challenging because the paddle gets smaller


## Class Ideas

 * Idea #1: A block class with different types of blocks that inherit the same class.
    This class might have the method ".break" to break the block when hit by a ball

 * Idea #2: A ball class with various types of balls. For example, some balls can be different sizes.
This class might contain the method ".move" to move the ball around the scene.

 * Idea #3: A power ups class that can be used to create different types of power ups. An example power up could be
    getting extra balls. One method in this class could be ".get" which means the player gets a power up to use.

 * Idea #4: A paddle class with various types of paddles such as larger paddles, which make it easier to play
 or paddles with different types of materials that make the ball bounce slower or faster.
