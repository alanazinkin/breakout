   of bouncing off it.

### Assignment Impressions
This assignment was a perfect introduction to this class. It taught me various 
essential skills for this course, and made me excited to learn new strategies for
designing and debugging code. However, it was also very challenging given the limited
office hours held during the first two weeks. A bit of extra support may have been helpful
as students get adjusted to this course. Overall, I enjoyed this project and am extremely proud of 
the progress I made in such a short period of time. I would certainly retain this project in future
semesters.
